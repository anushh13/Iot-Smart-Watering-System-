# IoT Smart Watering System  
## Objective:
This project aims to develop an IoT-based smart watering system that automates plant care, conserves water, and promotes healthy plant growth by monitoring soil moisture and environmental conditions.
## Introduction : 
This project aims to develop an IoT-based smart watering system that automates plant care, conserves water, and promotes healthy plant growth. By utilizing a moisture sensor, humidity and temperature sensor, NodeMCU microcontroller, relay module, pump, and pipes, this system can effectively monitor soil moisture levels and environmental conditions. Based on the collected data, the system can automatically activate the pump to water the plants, ensuring optimal hydration while minimizing water wastage.

## Problem Statement : 
Traditional plant care often relies on manual watering, which can be time-consuming, inconsistent, and inefficient. This project addresses these limitations by developing an IoT-based smart watering system that automates the watering process, ensuring optimal plant health while conserving water resources.

### Components Used :
Hardware Components 
- Moisture Sensor
- Humidity and Temperature Sensor
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- Relay Module
- Water Pump
- Pipes
- Power Supply
- Jumper Wires
- Breadboard

Software Used- 
- Arduino IDE
### Working 
1. Sensor Data Acquisition: The moisture sensor continuously monitors the soil moisture level. The humidity and temperature sensor measures the environmental conditions.

2. Data Processing: The NodeMCU microcontroller receives the sensor data and processes it. The microcontroller compares the current soil moisture level with a predefined threshold. It also considers the environmental conditions, such as humidity and temperature, to make a decision.

3. Pump Control: If the soil moisture level falls below the threshold or the environmental conditions indicate the need for watering, the microcontroller activates the relay module. The relay module, in turn, switches on the water pump. The pump delivers water to the plants through the pipes.

4. Automated Watering: The system continues to monitor the soil moisture and environmental conditions. The pump is activated or deactivated as needed to maintain optimal soil moisture levels. This automated process ensures efficient water usage and healthy plant growth.


## Conclusion : 
This project successfully demonstrates the implementation of an IoT-based smart watering system. By effectively monitoring soil moisture levels and environmental conditions, the system automates the watering process, conserving water and promoting healthy plant growth. Future improvements may include integrating advanced features like weather forecasting, machine learning-based optimization, and remote control through mobile apps.
